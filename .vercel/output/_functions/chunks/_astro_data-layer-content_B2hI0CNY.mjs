One of the most well-known hadiths is:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nعَنْ أَبِي هُرَيْرَةَ رَضِيَ اللهُ تَعَالَى عَنْهُ أَنَّ رَسُوْلَ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ قَالَ: مَنْ كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللهِ وَاليَوْمِ الآخِرِ فَلْيَقُلْ خَيْراً أَوْ لِيَصْمُتْ، وَمَنْ كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللهِ وَاليَوْمِ الآخِرِ فَلْيُكْرِمْ جَارَهُ، وَمَنْ كَانَ يُؤْمِنُ بِاللهِ وَاليَوْمِ الآخِرِ فَلْيُكْرِمْ ضَيْفَهُ.\r\nرَوَاهُ البُخَارِيُّ وَمُسْلِمٌ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From Abu Hurairah (RA), the <strong>Prophet ﷺ said:</strong> “Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should speak good or remain silent. Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should honor his neighbor. Whoever believes in Allah and the Last Day should honor his guest.” <i>(HR. Bukhari and Muslim) [Bukhari: 6018, 6019, 6136, 6475; Muslim: 47]</i></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This hadith emphasizes that honoring guests is part of a Muslim’s faith. <strong>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</strong> always demonstrated the best example in this regard, striving to provide the best for his guests—food, drink, and a kind, caring attitude.</p>\r\n\r\n#### Benefits of Hosting Guests According to the Quran and Sunnah\r\n\r\n1. **Strengthening Social Bonds**\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hosting or treating guests is an effective way to strengthen social relations and maintain family and community ties. Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala says in the Quran:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nوَاٰتِ ذَا الْقُرْبٰى حَقَّهٗ وَالْمِسْكِيْنَ وَابْنَ السَّبِيْلِ وَلَا تُبَذِّرْ تَبْذِيْرًا</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\"And give the relatives their due, and [also] the poor and the traveler, and do not spend wastefully.\" (QS. Al-Isra: 26)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This verse emphasizes the importance of sharing and considering others’ rights, including guests. By hosting guests, we show care and compassion, thereby strengthening bonds of brotherhood.</p>\r\n\r\n2. **Demonstrating Noble Character**\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">From ‘Abdullah bin ‘Amr (RA), it is reported:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nأَنَّ رَجُلاً سَأَلَ النَّبِىَّ – صلى الله عليه وسلم – أَىُّ الإِسْلاَمِ خَيْرٌ قَالَ تُطْعِمُ الطَّعَامَ ، وَتَقْرَأُ السَّلاَمَ عَلَى مَنْ عَرَفْتَ وَمَنْ لَمْ تَعْرِفْ</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“A man asked the Prophet ﷺ, ‘Which form of Islam is best?’ He said, ‘Feeding others, and greeting those you know and those you do not know.’” (HR. Bukhari: 12; Muslim: 39)</p>\r\n\r\n3. **Receiving Special Chambers in Paradise**\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As narrated by Imam Al-Tirmidhi from Sayyidina Ali, the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nإِنَّ فِى الْجَنَّةِ غُرَفًا تُرَى ظُهُورُهَا مِنْ بُطُونِهَا وَبُطُونُهَا مِنْ ظُهُورِهَا. فَقَامَ أَعْرَابِىٌّ فَقَالَ لِمَنْ هِىَ يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ قَالَ لِمَنْ أَطَابَ الْكَلاَمَ وَأَطْعَمَ الطَّعَامَ وَأَدَامَ الصِّيَامَ وَصَلَّى لِلَّهِ بِاللَّيْلِ وَالنَّاسُ نِيَامٌ</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Indeed, in Paradise there are chambers whose outside is visible from the inside and inside is visible from the outside.” A Bedouin asked, “Who are these chambers for, O Messenger of Allah?” The Prophet ﷺ replied, “For those who speak truthfully, feed others, keep fasting, and pray at night while people sleep.” (HR. Tirmidhi: 1984, Hasan according to Al-Albani)</p>\r\n\r\n4. **Guarantee of Paradise**\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As narrated by Imam Muslim from Abu Hurairah, the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nمَنْ أَصْبَحَ مِنْكُمْ الْيَوْمَ صَائِمًا قَالَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ أَنَا قَالَ فَمَنْ تَبِعَ مِنْكُمْ الْيَوْمَ جَنَازَةً قَالَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ أَنَا قَالَ فَمَنْ أَطْعَمَ مِنْكُمْ الْيَوْمَ مِسْكِينًا قَالَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ أَنَا قَالَ فَمَنْ عَادَ مِنْكُمْ الْيَوْمَ مَرِيضًا قَالَ أَبُو بَكْرٍ أَنَا فَقَالَ رَسُولُ اللَّهِ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ مَا اجْتَمَعْنَ فِي امْرِئٍ إِلَّا دَخَلَ الْجَنَّةَ</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Who among you today has fasted? Abu Bakr said, “I have.” Who among you today has followed a funeral? Abu Bakr said, “I have.” Who among you today has fed the poor? Abu Bakr said, “I have.” Who among you today has visited a sick person? Abu Bakr said, “I have.” The Prophet ﷺ said, “Whoever has combined these deeds, surely he will enter Paradise.”</p>\r\n\r\n#### Conclusion\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hosting or treating guests is a noble act highly encouraged in Islam. According to the Quran and Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, this practice not only strengthens social bonds and enhances brotherhood but also brings great reward.

This fitrah is to be a servant of Allah, meaning the religion of Allah. As stated in the Qur'an:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\r\nفَأَقِمْ وَجْهَكَ لِلدِّينِ حَنِيفًا ۚ فِطْرَتَ اللَّهِ الَّتِي فَطَرَ النَّاسَ عَلَيْهَا ۚ لَا تَبْدِيلَ لِخَلْقِ اللَّهِ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nSo set your face upright toward the religion, the fitrah of Allah upon which He has created mankind. There is no change in the creation of Allah. <i>[Ar-Rum/30:30]</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) also said:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\r\nكُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الفِطْرَةِ، فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ، أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ، أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nEvery child is born upon fitrah, then his parents make him a Jew, a Christian, or a Magian. <i>[HR. Al-Bukhari, no. 1319]</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nImam Nawawi said, “The most accurate meaning is that every child is born with a readiness to accept Islam.” <i>[1]</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nIbn Qayyim said, “This is the consensus among the early scholars of tafsir. They agreed that the phrase 'the fitrah of Allah upon which He created mankind' refers to the religion of Allah, Islam.” <i>[2]</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nHowever, in life, some humans deviate from their fitrah. They abandon the religion of Allah Azza wa Jalla, refuse to obey Him, and reject worship and submission to Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nFitrah only deviates due to causes that can alter its path. Among these causes are:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Satan or Iblis</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nThe invitation and temptation of Satan is the primary cause of human deviation. It is stated in a hadith Qudsi narrated by ‘Iyadh bin Himar:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\r\nوَإِنِّي خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءَ كُلَّهُمْ، وَإِنَّهُمْ أَتَتْهُمُ الشَّيَاطِينُ فَاجْتَالَتْهُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِمْ، وَحَرَّمَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ مَا أَحْلَلْتُ لَهُمْ، وَأَمَرَتْهُمْ أَنْ يُشْرِكُوا بِي مَا لَمْ أُنْزِلْ بِهِ سُلْطَانًا\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nIndeed, I have created My servants in a state of hanif (upright), but Satan comes to them and leads them away from their religion, forbids what I have made lawful, and commands them to associate partners with Me without any authority. <i>[HR. Muslim, no. 2865]</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Imitating Parents or Environment</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nChildren are greatly influenced by their environment, including family and society. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\r\nكُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الفِطْرَةِ، فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ، أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ، أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nChildren are born upon fitrah, then their parents make them Jews, Christians, or Magians. <i>[HR. Al-Bukhari, no. 1319]</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nA bad environment can lead to deviation from fitrah through imitation of parents or leaders, which is a tool of Satan to prevent humans from following Allah's path.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Neglect and Worldly Distractions</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nBeing distracted by worldly pleasures and wealth can make humans neglect Allah and deviate from fitrah. Allah says:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\r\nوَلَوْ بَسَطَ اللَّهُ الرِّزْقَ لِعِبَادِهِ لَبَغَوْا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَٰكِنْ يُنَزِّلُ بِقَدَرٍ مَا يَشَاءُ ۚ إِنَّهُ بِعِبَادِهِ خَبِيرٌ بَصِيرٌ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nIf Allah were to extend provision to His servants, they would transgress on earth. But He sends it in measured amounts. Indeed, He is All-Knowing, All-Seeing. <i>[Asy-Shura/42:27]</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Envy (Hasad)</h3>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nEnvy can also corrupt the fitrah and is considered a disease of previous nations. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\r\nدَبَّ إِلَيْكُمْ دَاءُ الْأُمَمِ قَبْلَكُمُ الْحَسَدُ وَالْبَغْضَاءُ، وَ هِيَ الْحَالِقَةُ لَا أَقُولُ تَحْلِقُ الشَّعْرَ وَلَكِنَّهَا تَحْلِقُ الدِّينَ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nEnvy and hatred are the diseases of nations before you. This is not a cutter of hair, but a cutter of religion. <i>[HR. At-Tirmidhi, no. 2510]</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nIbnul Qayyim said that the root of all sins is threefold: arrogance, greed, and envy. Whoever is protected from these three is protected from all evils. <i>[9]</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nMay Allah Azza wa Jalla protect us from all deviations from fitrah and facilitate our return to our natural state.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nBillâhittaufîq.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\r\nFootnotes:<br>\r\n<i>\r\n[1] Syarah Sahih Muslim, 16/208<br>\r\n[2] Shifa al-‘Alil, p. 285 and Ighatsatul Lahfan, 2/226-228<br>\r\n[3] Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/208<br>\r\n[4] Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 27/286<br>\r\n[5] Sharh Sahih Muslim, 16/219<br>\r\n[6] Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/154<br>\r\n[7] Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 25/332<br>\r\n[8] Iqtidha as-Shirath al-Mustaqim, 1/550<br>\r\n[9] al-Fawa’id, 1/58\r\n</i>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\nSource: https://almanhaj.or.id","src/content/blog/post3.md","96aec71b491b8e08",{html:151,metadata:152},"<p><strong>Every Child is Born with Fitrah</strong></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nWe are created by Allah Azza wa Jalla and endowed with fitrah.

There is no change in the creation of Allah. <i>[Ar-Rum/30:30]</i>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) also said:\n</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\nكُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الفِطْرَةِ، فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ، أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ، أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nEvery child is born upon fitrah, then his parents make him a Jew, a Christian, or a Magian. <i>[HR. Al-Bukhari, no. 1319]</i>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nImam Nawawi said, “The most accurate meaning is that every child is born with a readiness to accept Islam.” <i>[1]</i>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIbn Qayyim said, “This is the consensus among the early scholars of tafsir. They agreed that the phrase 'the fitrah of Allah upon which He created mankind' refers to the religion of Allah, Islam.” <i>[2]</i>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nHowever, in life, some humans deviate from their fitrah. They abandon the religion of Allah Azza wa Jalla, refuse to obey Him, and reject worship and submission to Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nFitrah only deviates due to causes that can alter its path. Among these causes are:\n</p>\n<h3>Satan or Iblis</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nThe invitation and temptation of Satan is the primary cause of human deviation. It is stated in a hadith Qudsi narrated by ‘Iyadh bin Himar:\n</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\nوَإِنِّي خَلَقْتُ عِبَادِي حُنَفَاءَ كُلَّهُمْ، وَإِنَّهُمْ أَتَتْهُمُ الشَّيَاطِينُ فَاجْتَالَتْهُمْ عَنْ دِينِهِمْ، وَحَرَّمَتْ عَلَيْهِمْ مَا أَحْلَلْتُ لَهُمْ، وَأَمَرَتْهُمْ أَنْ يُشْرِكُوا بِي مَا لَمْ أُنْزِلْ بِهِ سُلْطَانًا\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIndeed, I have created My servants in a state of hanif (upright), but Satan comes to them and leads them away from their religion, forbids what I have made lawful, and commands them to associate partners with Me without any authority. <i>[HR. Muslim, no. 2865]</i>\n</p>\n<h3>Imitating Parents or Environment</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nChildren are greatly influenced by their environment, including family and society. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:\n</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\nكُلُّ مَوْلُودٍ يُولَدُ عَلَى الفِطْرَةِ، فَأَبَوَاهُ يُهَوِّدَانِهِ، أَوْ يُنَصِّرَانِهِ، أَوْ يُمَجِّسَانِهِ\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nChildren are born upon fitrah, then their parents make them Jews, Christians, or Magians. <i>[HR. Al-Bukhari, no. 1319]</i>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nA bad environment can lead to deviation from fitrah through imitation of parents or leaders, which is a tool of Satan to prevent humans from following Allah's path.\n</p>\n<h3>Neglect and Worldly Distractions</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nBeing distracted by worldly pleasures and wealth can make humans neglect Allah and deviate from fitrah. Allah says:\n</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\nوَلَوْ بَسَطَ اللَّهُ الرِّزْقَ لِعِبَادِهِ لَبَغَوْا فِي الْأَرْضِ وَلَٰكِنْ يُنَزِّلُ بِقَدَرٍ مَا يَشَاءُ ۚ إِنَّهُ بِعِبَادِهِ خَبِيرٌ بَصِيرٌ\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIf Allah were to extend provision to His servants, they would transgress on earth. But He sends it in measured amounts. Indeed, He is All-Knowing, All-Seeing. <i>[Asy-Shura/42:27]</i>\n</p>\n<h3>Envy (Hasad)</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nEnvy can also corrupt the fitrah and is considered a disease of previous nations. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:\n</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;\">\nدَبَّ إِلَيْكُمْ دَاءُ الْأُمَمِ قَبْلَكُمُ الْحَسَدُ وَالْبَغْضَاءُ، وَ هِيَ الْحَالِقَةُ لَا أَقُولُ تَحْلِقُ الشَّعْرَ وَلَكِنَّهَا تَحْلِقُ الدِّينَ\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nEnvy and hatred are the diseases of nations before you. This is not a cutter of hair, but a cutter of religion. <i>[HR. At-Tirmidhi, no. 2510]</i>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nIbnul Qayyim said that the root of all sins is threefold: arrogance, greed, and envy. Whoever is protected from these three is protected from all evils. <i>[9]</i>\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nMay Allah Azza wa Jalla protect us from all deviations from fitrah and facilitate our return to our natural state.\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nBillâhittaufîq.\n</p>\n<hr>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\nFootnotes:<br>\n<i>\n[1] Syarah Sahih Muslim, 16/208<br>\n[2] Shifa al-‘Alil, p. 285 and Ighatsatul Lahfan, 2/226-228<br>\n[3] Tafsir Ibn Kathir, 5/208<br>\n[4] Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 27/286<br>\n[5] Sharh Sahih Muslim, 16/219<br>\n[6] Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 22/154<br>\n[7] Majmu’ al-Fatawa, 25/332<br>\n[8] Iqtidha as-Shirath al-Mustaqim, 1/550<br>\n[9] al-Fawa’id, 1/58\n</i>\n</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://almanhaj.or.id\">https://almanhaj.or.id</a></p>",{headings:153,localImagePaths:154,remoteImagePaths:155,frontmatter:156,imagePaths:159},[],[],[],{title:135,description:136,pubDate:157,heroImage:138,tags:158},"May 02 2024",[140,141,142,143,144,145,26,27,146],[],"post3.md","post6",{id:161,data:163,body:181,filePath:182,digest:183,rendered:184,legacyId:211},{title:164,description:165,pubDate:166,heroImage:167,tags:168},"Shaking the Bed","Shaking the bed is a practice in Islam that encourages a person to clean their bed before sleeping.

When spiritual fatigue hits, even performing obligatory acts can feel burdensome. All the more, performing voluntary acts becomes harder. For instance, praying the sunnah rawatib may feel heavy, fasting on Mondays and Thursdays may feel almost impossible, and even remembering Allah with simple verbal dhikr may feel beyond our capacity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, as believers, we must not allow this to continue. During such moments, the whispers of Satan threatening our faith can come from various directions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do not merely wait for guidance to come; actively seek it. Allah Ta’ala says in a Hadith Qudsi,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nيا عبادي كلُّكم ضالٌّ إلَّا من هديتُه ، فاستهدوني أهدِكُ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“O My servants, you are all misguided except those whom I guide. So seek guidance from Me, and I will guide you.” (HR. Muslim no. 2577, narrated by Abu Dzar Al-Ghifari radhiyallahu ‘anhu)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lessons from the predecessors: Learning from the previous generations, many of them never received guidance because they lacked the intention, determination, and effort to pursue it. Guidance will not come unless there is sincere effort from within.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if those around them try their best to direct them toward strong faith, when an individual lacks intention and effort, guidance remains elusive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My brothers, consider the close relationships between children and fathers, such as Habil bin Adam ‘alaihissalam, Kan’an bin Nuh ‘alaihissalam, and Ibrahim ‘alaihissalam bin Azar; or between husband and wife, like Walilah, the wife of Prophet Lut ‘alaihissalam; and between nephew and uncle, such as Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his uncle Abu Talib.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite their closeness to the Prophets ﷺ, guidance was not guaranteed. Even Prophet Muhammad ﷺ could not grant guidance to his beloved uncle. Allah Ta’ala says,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nإِنَّكَ لَا تَهۡدِی مَنۡ أَحۡبَبۡتَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ یَهۡدِی مَن یَشَاۤءُۚ وَهُوَ أَعۡلَمُ بِٱلۡمُهۡتَدِینَ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Indeed, you (Muhammad) cannot guide whom you love, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He knows best those who are rightly guided.” (QS. Al-Qasas: 56)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nowadays, we often witness people who were once pious and obedient but have fallen into disobedience and sin. May Allah protect us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spiritual negligence often leads to disbelief. We do not know Allah’s decree recorded in the Preserved Tablet (Lauh Mahfuz). Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nفوالَّذي لا إلَهَ غيرُهُ إنَّ أحدَكُم ليعملُ بعملِ أَهْلِ الجنَّةِ حتَّى ما يَكونُ بينَهُ وبينَها إلَّا ذراعٌ ثمَّ يسبِقُ علَيهِ الكتابُ فيُختَمُ لَهُ بعملِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ فيدخلُها ، وإنَّ أحدَكُم ليعملُ بعملِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ حتَّى ما يَكونَ بينَهُ وبينَها إلَّا ذراعٌ ثمَّ يسبِقُ علَيهِ الكتابُ فيُختَمُ لَهُ بعملِ أَهْلِ الجنَّةِ فيَدخلُها\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“By Allah, one of you may act with the deeds of the people of Paradise until only an arm’s length separates him from it, but then the decree precedes him, and he is recorded among the deeds of the people of Hell, so he enters it. Likewise, one of you may act with the deeds of the people of Hell until only an arm’s length separates him from it, but the decree precedes him, and he is recorded among the deeds of the people of Paradise, so he enters it.” (HR. Tirmidhi no. 2137, narrated by Abdullah bin Mas’ud radhiyallahu ‘anhu)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This Hadith reminds us that no servant knows or can guarantee the outcome of their deeds in the Hereafter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, reflect! A person who once performed righteous deeds may end his life in sin. And one who is accustomed to disobedience may fall deeper due to spiritual fatigue, which can ultimately lead to disbelief. May Allah protect us.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, we must believe that each person is aided in their deeds. Cultivate righteousness consistently. When fatigue strikes, seek Allah’s help and strive as much as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Continuing in good deeds: Jabir radhiyallahu ‘anhu narrated that Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju’syum asked,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“O Messenger of Allah, explain to us about our religion as if we were newly created. Why should we act today? Is it for things already decreed, or for the future?”</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Prophet ﷺ replied,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nقَالَ: لَا، بَلْ فِيمَا جَفَّتْ بِهِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَجَرَتْ بِهِ الْمَقَادِيرُ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“No, but for that which the pens have written and the decrees have flowed.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He then asked, “Then what is the purpose of acting?” The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nاعْمَلُوا، فَكُلٌّ مُيَسَّرٌ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Act, for everyone is facilitated (for what has been decreed for them).” (HR. Muslim no. 2648)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Overcoming spiritual fatigue: First, seek help and guidance from Allah. Whenever spiritual fatigue strikes, the first step is to pray for guidance. Guidance must be actively sought through sincere supplication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As taught in the morning dhikr taught by the Prophet ﷺ to Fatimah radhiyallahu ‘anha:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nيَا حَيُّ يَا قَيُّوْمُ بِرَحْمَتِكَ أَسْتَغِيْثُ، وَأَصْلِحْ لِيْ شَأْنِيْ كُلَّهُ وَلاَ تَكِلْنِيْ إِلَى نَفْسِيْ طَرْفَةَ عَيْنٍ أَبَدًا\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“O Ever-Living, O Self-Sustaining, by Your mercy I seek help; rectify all my affairs and never leave me to myself even for a blink of an eye.” (HR. Ibn As-Sunni no. 46)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After praying, strive to remain steadfast in good deeds. Even when fatigue strikes, do not neglect obligatory acts, and avoid sin regardless of temptation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Prophet ﷺ advised,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nاتَّقِ اللَّهَ حيثُ ما كنتَ ، وأتبعِ السَّيِّئةَ الحسنةَ تمحُها ، وخالقِ النَّاسَ بخلقٍ حسنٍ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Fear Allah wherever you are. Follow up a bad deed with a good deed that will erase it, and treat people with good manners.” (HR. Tirmidhi no. 1987, narrated by Abu Dzar Al-Ghifari radhiyallahu ‘anhu)</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Third, perform dhikr regularly. Even small acts like verbal remembrance of Allah carry immense weight. When spiritual fatigue hits, dhikr is easy to perform as it requires little energy beyond moving the tongue to recite Allah’s names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah Ta’ala says,</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\r\nفَٱذْكُرُونِىٓ أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لِى وَلَا تَكْفُرُونِ\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“So remember Me; I will remember you.

When spiritual fatigue hits, even performing obligatory acts can feel burdensome. All the more, performing voluntary acts becomes harder. For instance, praying the sunnah rawatib may feel heavy, fasting on Mondays and Thursdays may feel almost impossible, and even remembering Allah with simple verbal dhikr may feel beyond our capacity.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, as believers, we must not allow this to continue. During such moments, the whispers of Satan threatening our faith can come from various directions.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Do not merely wait for guidance to come; actively seek it. Allah Ta’ala says in a Hadith Qudsi,</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\nيا عبادي كلُّكم ضالٌّ إلَّا من هديتُه ، فاستهدوني أهدِكُ\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“O My servants, you are all misguided except those whom I guide. So seek guidance from Me, and I will guide you.” (HR. Muslim no. 2577, narrated by Abu Dzar Al-Ghifari radhiyallahu ‘anhu)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Lessons from the predecessors: Learning from the previous generations, many of them never received guidance because they lacked the intention, determination, and effort to pursue it. Guidance will not come unless there is sincere effort from within.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if those around them try their best to direct them toward strong faith, when an individual lacks intention and effort, guidance remains elusive.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My brothers, consider the close relationships between children and fathers, such as Habil bin Adam ‘alaihissalam, Kan’an bin Nuh ‘alaihissalam, and Ibrahim ‘alaihissalam bin Azar; or between husband and wife, like Walilah, the wife of Prophet Lut ‘alaihissalam; and between nephew and uncle, such as Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his uncle Abu Talib.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Despite their closeness to the Prophets ﷺ, guidance was not guaranteed. Even Prophet Muhammad ﷺ could not grant guidance to his beloved uncle. Allah Ta’ala says,</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\nإِنَّكَ لَا تَهۡدِی مَنۡ أَحۡبَبۡتَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ یَهۡدِی مَن یَشَاۤءُۚ وَهُوَ أَعۡلَمُ بِٱلۡمُهۡتَدِینَ\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Indeed, you (Muhammad) cannot guide whom you love, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He knows best those who are rightly guided.” (QS. Al-Qasas: 56)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Nowadays, we often witness people who were once pious and obedient but have fallen into disobedience and sin. May Allah protect us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Spiritual negligence often leads to disbelief. We do not know Allah’s decree recorded in the Preserved Tablet (Lauh Mahfuz). Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said,</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\nفوالَّذي لا إلَهَ غيرُهُ إنَّ أحدَكُم ليعملُ بعملِ أَهْلِ الجنَّةِ حتَّى ما يَكونُ بينَهُ وبينَها إلَّا ذراعٌ ثمَّ يسبِقُ علَيهِ الكتابُ فيُختَمُ لَهُ بعملِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ فيدخلُها ، وإنَّ أحدَكُم ليعملُ بعملِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ حتَّى ما يَكونَ بينَهُ وبينَها إلَّا ذراعٌ ثمَّ يسبِقُ علَيهِ الكتابُ فيُختَمُ لَهُ بعملِ أَهْلِ الجنَّةِ فيَدخلُها\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“By Allah, one of you may act with the deeds of the people of Paradise until only an arm’s length separates him from it, but then the decree precedes him, and he is recorded among the deeds of the people of Hell, so he enters it. Likewise, one of you may act with the deeds of the people of Hell until only an arm’s length separates him from it, but the decree precedes him, and he is recorded among the deeds of the people of Paradise, so he enters it.” (HR. Tirmidhi no. 2137, narrated by Abdullah bin Mas’ud radhiyallahu ‘anhu)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This Hadith reminds us that no servant knows or can guarantee the outcome of their deeds in the Hereafter.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Therefore, reflect! A person who once performed righteous deeds may end his life in sin. And one who is accustomed to disobedience may fall deeper due to spiritual fatigue, which can ultimately lead to disbelief. May Allah protect us.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thus, we must believe that each person is aided in their deeds. Cultivate righteousness consistently. When fatigue strikes, seek Allah’s help and strive as much as possible.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Continuing in good deeds: Jabir radhiyallahu ‘anhu narrated that Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju’syum asked,</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“O Messenger of Allah, explain to us about our religion as if we were newly created. Why should we act today? Is it for things already decreed, or for the future?”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Prophet ﷺ replied,</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\nقَالَ: لَا، بَلْ فِيمَا جَفَّتْ بِهِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَجَرَتْ بِهِ الْمَقَادِيرُ\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“No, but for that which the pens have written and the decrees have flowed.”</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">He then asked, “Then what is the purpose of acting?” The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\nاعْمَلُوا، فَكُلٌّ مُيَسَّرٌ\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Act, for everyone is facilitated (for what has been decreed for them).” (HR. Muslim no. 2648)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Overcoming spiritual fatigue: First, seek help and guidance from Allah. Whenever spiritual fatigue strikes, the first step is to pray for guidance. Guidance must be actively sought through sincere supplication.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As taught in the morning dhikr taught by the Prophet ﷺ to Fatimah radhiyallahu ‘anha:</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\nيَا حَيُّ يَا قَيُّوْمُ بِرَحْمَتِكَ أَسْتَغِيْثُ، وَأَصْلِحْ لِيْ شَأْنِيْ كُلَّهُ وَلاَ تَكِلْنِيْ إِلَى نَفْسِيْ طَرْفَةَ عَيْنٍ أَبَدًا\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“O Ever-Living, O Self-Sustaining, by Your mercy I seek help; rectify all my affairs and never leave me to myself even for a blink of an eye.” (HR. Ibn As-Sunni no. 46)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">After praying, strive to remain steadfast in good deeds. Even when fatigue strikes, do not neglect obligatory acts, and avoid sin regardless of temptation.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Prophet ﷺ advised,</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\nاتَّقِ اللَّهَ حيثُ ما كنتَ ، وأتبعِ السَّيِّئةَ الحسنةَ تمحُها ، وخالقِ النَّاسَ بخلقٍ حسنٍ\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Fear Allah wherever you are. Follow up a bad deed with a good deed that will erase it, and treat people with good manners.” (HR. Tirmidhi no. 1987, narrated by Abu Dzar Al-Ghifari radhiyallahu ‘anhu)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Third, perform dhikr regularly. Even small acts like verbal remembrance of Allah carry immense weight. When spiritual fatigue hits, dhikr is easy to perform as it requires little energy beyond moving the tongue to recite Allah’s names.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Allah Ta’ala says,</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: &#x27;Neirizi Regular&#x27;, sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;\">\nفَٱذْكُرُونِىٓ أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لِى وَلَا تَكْفُرُونِ\n</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me.” (QS. Al-Baqarah: 152)</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My brothers, during spiritual fatigue, we need nothing but Allah Ta’ala.
