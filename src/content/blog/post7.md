**Blowing on Hot Drinks**

<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the etiquettes of eating and drinking is that it is forbidden to breathe into a container or to blow on food or drink. This etiquette is sometimes overlooked because people want to quickly enjoy their hot drink. However, waiting a little or drinking without blowing is safer and healthier. It should be understood that when one blows on a drink, the air expelled is not clean. For this reason, <strong>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</strong> prohibited this practice.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From Abu Sa’id Al-Khudri, he said,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
أَنَّ النَّبِىَّ -صلى الله عليه وسلم- نَهَى عَنِ النَّفْخِ فِى الشُّرْبِ. فَقَالَ رَجُلٌ الْقَذَاةُ أَرَاهَا فِى الإِنَاءِ قَالَ « أَهْرِقْهَا ». قَالَ فَإِنِّى لاَ أَرْوَى مِنْ نَفَسٍ وَاحِدٍ قَالَ « فَأَبِنِ الْقَدَحَ إِذًا عَنْ فِيكَ »
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“The Prophet ﷺ</strong> prohibited blowing on a drink. Someone asked, 'What if there is dirt that I see in the container?' He said, 'Just pour it out.' He said, 'I cannot drink it in one breath.' He said, 'Then keep the container away from your mouth.'” (HR. Tirmidhi no. 1887 and Ahmad 3:26. Al-Hafizh Abu Thohir said the chain of narration is authentic. Abu Isa Tirmidhi said this hadith is hasan sahih).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From Ibn ‘Abbas radhiyallahu ‘anhuma, he said,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
نَهَى رَسُولُ اللَّهِ -صلى الله عليه وسلم- أَنْ يُتَنَفَّسَ فِى الإِنَاءِ أَوْ يُنْفَخَ فِيهِ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>“The Prophet ﷺ</strong> prohibited breathing into a container (of drink) or blowing on it.” (HR. Tirmidhi no. 1888, Abu Dawud no. 3728, Ibn Majah no. 3429. Al-Hafizh Abu Thohir said this hadith is authentic). Imam Nawawi rahimahullah included both hadiths in his book on the etiquettes of eating under the chapter “It is disliked to blow on drinks.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As mentioned, breathing into a container is prohibited. This means taking a breath inside the container while drinking is forbidden. What is allowed is breathing outside the container. Meanwhile, blowing on a drink—as Ibn Hajar explained—is considered worse than merely breathing into it. Ibn Hajar in <em>Fathul Bari</em> stated,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
وَالنَّفْخ فِي هَذِهِ الْأَحْوَال كُلّهَا أَشَدُّ مِنْ التَّنَفُّس
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Blowing on a drink in these conditions is more severe than simply breathing into the container.” Sheikh Muhammad bin Sholeh Al ‘Utsaimin explained that when someone blows on a drink, the air released is dirty, which is why the Prophet ﷺ prohibited it.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet ﷺ also said that if someone cannot drink in one breath, they may drink, then breathe outside the container, and then drink again. Sheikh Ibn ‘Utsaimin noted that some scholars allow blowing on a hot drink if necessary to cool it quickly. However, Sheikh Ibn ‘Utsaimin maintained that it is preferable not to blow on hot drinks. An alternative solution to cool a hot drink without blowing is to pour it into another container and then pour it back. This method is permissible and avoids the prohibited action. (Explanation from Syarh Riyadhis Sholihin, 4:245)</p>
