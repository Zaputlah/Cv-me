**Knocking That Does Not Disturb**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Visiting and hosting each other is common, whether among family members, neighbors, or friends living in dorms. However, many people forget or do not know the proper etiquette of visiting, which Islam has clearly outlined. It is beautiful if every action we do is intended as worship to Allah and following the example of <strong>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</strong>, including the etiquette of visiting.</p>

*1. Ask Permission Up to Three Times*

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</strong> taught that the limit for asking permission to enter a house is three times. As he said:</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;">
اَلْاسْتِئْذَانُ ثَلاَثٌ، فَاِنْ أُذِنَ لَكَ وَاِلاَّ فَارْجِعْ
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From Abu Musa Al-Ash’ari (RA), he said: <strong>“The Prophet ﷺ said:</strong> ‘Ask permission to enter a house three times. If permission is granted, then enter; if not, then leave!’” <i>(HR. Bukhari and Muslim)</i></p>

*2. Greet and Ask Permission to Enter*

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes a visitor calls the person’s name or says something casually. <strong>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</strong> taught that one should greet and ask permission. Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala says:</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;">
يٰٓاَيُّهَا الَّذِيْنَ اٰمَنُوْا لَا تَدْخُلُوْا بُيُوْتًا غَيْرَ بُيُوْتِكُمْ حَتّٰى تَسْتَأْنِسُوْا وَتُسَلِّمُوْا عَلٰٓى اَهْلِهَاۗ ذٰلِكُمْ خَيْرٌ لَّكُمْ لَعَلَّكُمْ تَذَكَّرُوْنَ
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“O you who believe, do not enter houses other than your own without asking permission and greeting its inhabitants. That is better for you, so you may remember.” <i>(QS. An-Nur [24]:27)</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As narrated from Kildah ibn al-Hambal (RA):</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I approached the Prophet ﷺ and entered his house without greeting. The Prophet ﷺ said: ‘Go out and repeat with “Assalamu’alaikum”, may I enter?’” <i>(HR. Abu Dawud, Tirmidhi – Hasan)</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The limit for greeting and asking permission is three times. If permission is not granted after three greetings, the visitor should delay the visit. Even if the greeting is answered, one should still ask for permission before entering, so the household can prepare and conceal any private matters. As Sahal ibn Sa’ad (RA) reported, the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“The reason asking permission is prescribed is to guard one’s gaze.” <i>(HR. Bukhari and Muslim)</i></p>

*3. Knock Gently*

<p style="text-align: justify;">Sometimes guests knock too hard or in a disturbing way. The knock should be gentle and not startling. Anas bin Malik (RA) said:</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;">
إِنَّ أَبْوَابَ النَّبِي صَلَّى الله عَلَيهِ وَسَلَّمَ كَانَتْ تَقْرَعُ بِالْأظَافِيرِ
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“During the time of the Prophet ﷺ, we knocked on the door with our fingernails.” <i>(HR. Bukhari, Adabul Mufrad)</i></p>

*4. Stand Off to the Side, Not Facing the Door*

<p style="text-align: justify;">Visitors should not stand directly in front of the door facing inside, allowing the host to prepare themselves and their home. Abdullah bin Bisyr reported:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“When the Prophet ﷺ approached a door, he did not face it directly but stood to the side and said ‘Assalamu’alaikum’…” <i>(HR. Abu Dawud)</i></p>

*5. Do Not Peek*

<p style="text-align: justify;">Peeking inside is condemned. The Prophet ﷺ warned against it. Anas bin Malik (RA) said:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“A man peeked into part of the Prophet’s ﷺ room. The Prophet ﷺ stood toward him with broad arrows as if to warn him.” <i>(HR. Bukhari, Kitabul Isti’dzan)</i></p>

*6. Leave If Asked*

<p style="text-align: justify;">If a host asks a visitor to leave or does not answer after three greetings, the visitor should respect it without feeling offended. Allah says:</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;">
فَاِنْ لَّمْ تَجِدُوْا فِيْهَآ اَحَدًا فَلَا تَدْخُلُوْهَا حَتّٰى يُؤْذَنَ لَكُمْ وَاِنْ قِيْلَ لَكُمُ ارْجِعُوْا فَارْجِعُوْا هُوَ اَزْكٰى لَكُمْ ۗوَاللّٰهُ بِمَا تَعْمَلُوْنَ عَلِيْمٌ
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“If no one is there, do not enter until permission is granted. And if told to return, then return. That is purer for you, and Allah is All-Knowing of what you do.” <i>(QS. An-Nur [24]:28)</i></p>

*7. Respond with Full Name When Asked “Who?”*

<p style="text-align: justify;">If the host asks “Who is it?”, the visitor should clearly state their name, not just “me.” Jabir (RA) said:</p>
<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl; font-weight: bold;">
أَتَيْتُ النَّبِيَّ صَلَّى اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ فِي دَيْنٍ كَانَ عَلَى أَبِي فَدَقَقْتُ الْبَابَ فَقَالَ مَنْ ذَا فَقُلْتُ أَنَا فَقَالَ أَنَا أَنَا كَأَنَّهُ كَرِهَهَا
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“I approached the Prophet ﷺ and knocked. He asked, ‘Who is it?’ I said, ‘Me.’ He asked again, ‘Me, me?’ It seemed he did not like it.” <i>(HR. Bukhari and Muslim)</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">By following these etiquettes, our visits become in accordance with the teachings of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Understanding these rules also makes us more considerate and respectful to hosts. Wallahu a’lam.</p>
