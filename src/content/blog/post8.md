**Rest When You Are Tired**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Let us reflect for a moment. When spiritual fatigue hits, even performing obligatory acts can feel burdensome. All the more, performing voluntary acts becomes harder. For instance, praying the sunnah rawatib may feel heavy, fasting on Mondays and Thursdays may feel almost impossible, and even remembering Allah with simple verbal dhikr may feel beyond our capacity.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, as believers, we must not allow this to continue. During such moments, the whispers of Satan threatening our faith can come from various directions.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Do not merely wait for guidance to come; actively seek it. Allah Ta’ala says in a Hadith Qudsi,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
يا عبادي كلُّكم ضالٌّ إلَّا من هديتُه ، فاستهدوني أهدِكُ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“O My servants, you are all misguided except those whom I guide. So seek guidance from Me, and I will guide you.” (HR. Muslim no. 2577, narrated by Abu Dzar Al-Ghifari radhiyallahu ‘anhu)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Lessons from the predecessors: Learning from the previous generations, many of them never received guidance because they lacked the intention, determination, and effort to pursue it. Guidance will not come unless there is sincere effort from within.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Even if those around them try their best to direct them toward strong faith, when an individual lacks intention and effort, guidance remains elusive.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My brothers, consider the close relationships between children and fathers, such as Habil bin Adam ‘alaihissalam, Kan’an bin Nuh ‘alaihissalam, and Ibrahim ‘alaihissalam bin Azar; or between husband and wife, like Walilah, the wife of Prophet Lut ‘alaihissalam; and between nephew and uncle, such as Prophet Muhammad ﷺ and his uncle Abu Talib.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite their closeness to the Prophets ﷺ, guidance was not guaranteed. Even Prophet Muhammad ﷺ could not grant guidance to his beloved uncle. Allah Ta’ala says,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
إِنَّكَ لَا تَهۡدِی مَنۡ أَحۡبَبۡتَ وَلَـٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ یَهۡدِی مَن یَشَاۤءُۚ وَهُوَ أَعۡلَمُ بِٱلۡمُهۡتَدِینَ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Indeed, you (Muhammad) cannot guide whom you love, but Allah guides whom He wills. And He knows best those who are rightly guided.” (QS. Al-Qasas: 56)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Nowadays, we often witness people who were once pious and obedient but have fallen into disobedience and sin. May Allah protect us.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Spiritual negligence often leads to disbelief. We do not know Allah’s decree recorded in the Preserved Tablet (Lauh Mahfuz). Prophet Muhammad ﷺ said,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
فوالَّذي لا إلَهَ غيرُهُ إنَّ أحدَكُم ليعملُ بعملِ أَهْلِ الجنَّةِ حتَّى ما يَكونُ بينَهُ وبينَها إلَّا ذراعٌ ثمَّ يسبِقُ علَيهِ الكتابُ فيُختَمُ لَهُ بعملِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ فيدخلُها ، وإنَّ أحدَكُم ليعملُ بعملِ أَهْلِ النَّارِ حتَّى ما يَكونَ بينَهُ وبينَها إلَّا ذراعٌ ثمَّ يسبِقُ علَيهِ الكتابُ فيُختَمُ لَهُ بعملِ أَهْلِ الجنَّةِ فيَدخلُها
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“By Allah, one of you may act with the deeds of the people of Paradise until only an arm’s length separates him from it, but then the decree precedes him, and he is recorded among the deeds of the people of Hell, so he enters it. Likewise, one of you may act with the deeds of the people of Hell until only an arm’s length separates him from it, but the decree precedes him, and he is recorded among the deeds of the people of Paradise, so he enters it.” (HR. Tirmidhi no. 2137, narrated by Abdullah bin Mas’ud radhiyallahu ‘anhu)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This Hadith reminds us that no servant knows or can guarantee the outcome of their deeds in the Hereafter.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Therefore, reflect! A person who once performed righteous deeds may end his life in sin. And one who is accustomed to disobedience may fall deeper due to spiritual fatigue, which can ultimately lead to disbelief. May Allah protect us.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Thus, we must believe that each person is aided in their deeds. Cultivate righteousness consistently. When fatigue strikes, seek Allah’s help and strive as much as possible.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Continuing in good deeds: Jabir radhiyallahu ‘anhu narrated that Suraqah bin Malik bin Ju’syum asked,</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“O Messenger of Allah, explain to us about our religion as if we were newly created. Why should we act today? Is it for things already decreed, or for the future?”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet ﷺ replied,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
قَالَ: لَا، بَلْ فِيمَا جَفَّتْ بِهِ الْأَقْلَامُ وَجَرَتْ بِهِ الْمَقَادِيرُ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“No, but for that which the pens have written and the decrees have flowed.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">He then asked, “Then what is the purpose of acting?” The Prophet ﷺ said,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
اعْمَلُوا، فَكُلٌّ مُيَسَّرٌ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Act, for everyone is facilitated (for what has been decreed for them).” (HR. Muslim no. 2648)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Overcoming spiritual fatigue: First, seek help and guidance from Allah. Whenever spiritual fatigue strikes, the first step is to pray for guidance. Guidance must be actively sought through sincere supplication.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As taught in the morning dhikr taught by the Prophet ﷺ to Fatimah radhiyallahu ‘anha:</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
يَا حَيُّ يَا قَيُّوْمُ بِرَحْمَتِكَ أَسْتَغِيْثُ، وَأَصْلِحْ لِيْ شَأْنِيْ كُلَّهُ وَلاَ تَكِلْنِيْ إِلَى نَفْسِيْ طَرْفَةَ عَيْنٍ أَبَدًا
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“O Ever-Living, O Self-Sustaining, by Your mercy I seek help; rectify all my affairs and never leave me to myself even for a blink of an eye.” (HR. Ibn As-Sunni no. 46)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">After praying, strive to remain steadfast in good deeds. Even when fatigue strikes, do not neglect obligatory acts, and avoid sin regardless of temptation.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Prophet ﷺ advised,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
اتَّقِ اللَّهَ حيثُ ما كنتَ ، وأتبعِ السَّيِّئةَ الحسنةَ تمحُها ، وخالقِ النَّاسَ بخلقٍ حسنٍ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Fear Allah wherever you are. Follow up a bad deed with a good deed that will erase it, and treat people with good manners.” (HR. Tirmidhi no. 1987, narrated by Abu Dzar Al-Ghifari radhiyallahu ‘anhu)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Third, perform dhikr regularly. Even small acts like verbal remembrance of Allah carry immense weight. When spiritual fatigue hits, dhikr is easy to perform as it requires little energy beyond moving the tongue to recite Allah’s names.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Allah Ta’ala says,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
فَٱذْكُرُونِىٓ أَذْكُرْكُمْ وَٱشْكُرُوا۟ لِى وَلَا تَكْفُرُونِ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“So remember Me; I will remember you. And be grateful to Me and do not deny Me.” (QS. Al-Baqarah: 152)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">My brothers, during spiritual fatigue, we need nothing but Allah Ta’ala. The way to gain Allah’s attention is through dhikr. Make it a habit to remember Allah in every action, from morning dhikr and prayers, to all activities performed throughout the day.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Among the easy-to-pronounce, yet heavy-in-weight dhikr beloved to Allah are, as narrated by Abu Hurairah radhiyallahu ‘anhu,</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
كَلِمَتَانِ خَفِيفَتَانِ عَلَى اللِّسَانِ ، ثَقِيلَتَانِ فِى الْمِيزَانِ ، حَبِيبَتَانِ إِلَى الرَّحْمَنِ سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ وَبِحَمْدِهِ ، سُبْحَانَ اللَّهِ الْعَظِيمِ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Two phrases that are light on the tongue, heavy on the scale, and beloved to the Most Merciful: Subhanallahi wa bihamdihi, Subhanallahil ‘Azim (Glory be to Allah and all praise is due to Him, Glory be to Allah the Almighty).” (HR. Bukhari no. 6682 and Muslim no. 2694)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And Allah knows best.</p>
