### Shaking the Bed According to Islamic Teachings

<p style="text-align: justify;">The bed is one of the important places in daily life. Islam, as a complete way of life, provides clear guidance on proper living, including maintaining cleanliness and comfort in one’s bed. Below is a discussion on shaking the bed according to the teachings of <strong>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</strong> and the Quran.</p>

#### 1. Guidance from the Quran

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Quran, Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala emphasizes the importance of cleanliness and comfort in daily life. Verses such as QS. Al-Baqarah: 222 teach Muslims to maintain personal hygiene and health, including keeping the bed clean.</p>

#### 2. Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</strong> provided exemplary guidance in all aspects of life, including maintaining a clean bed. A hadith narrated by Abu Hurairah states that the Prophet ﷺ said:</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
إِذَا جَاءَ أَحَدُكُمْ إِلَى فِرَاشِهِ فَلْيَأْخُذْ دَاخِلَةَ إِزَارِهِ فَلْيَنْفُضْ بِهَا فِرَاشَهُ وَلْيُسَمِّ اللهَ فَإِنَّهُ لاَ يَعْلَمُ مَا خَلَفَهُ بَعْدَهُ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"When one of you goes to his bed, let him shake his bed with his garment or sweep it with his right hand, and say Bismillah, for he does not know what may have come upon it after him." (HR. Bukhari)</p>

#### 3. Importance of Shaking the Bed

<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaking the bed is a simple yet meaningful act in Islam. It reflects concern for cleanliness, health, and comfort, and protects oneself from possible diseases or dirt that may be present on the bed.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaking the bed is also a way of expressing gratitude to Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala for the blessing of sleep. By keeping the bed clean, we safeguard our health, maintain personal dignity, and preserve a clean surrounding environment.</p>

#### 4. Practical Steps

<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaking the bed can be done by sweeping or shaking clothes over the bed before sleeping. This helps remove dirt or dust that may have settled, creating a clean and comfortable sleeping environment.</p>

#### 5. Conclusion

<p style="text-align: justify;">Shaking the bed is a simple but highly meaningful practice in Islam. By following the guidance of the Quran and the Sunnah of <strong>Prophet Muhammad ﷺ</strong>, we can maintain the cleanliness and comfort of our beds while protecting ourselves from possible illnesses. In this way, this practice becomes a part of daily worship that draws us closer to Allah Subhanahu wa Ta’ala.</p>
