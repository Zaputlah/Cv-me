**Modesty**

<p style="text-align: justify;">Modesty is the legacy of the prophets, meaning it was taught by the Prophets before us.
From Abu Mas’ud Uqbah bin Amr Al-Anshary Al-Badry (may Allah be pleased with him), he said:</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
قَالَ رَسُوْلُ اللهِ صَلَّى اللهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ : إِنَّ مِمَّا أَدْرَكَ النَّاسُ مِنْ كَلاَمِ النُّبُوَّةِ الأُوْلَى، إِذَا لَمْ تَسْتَحِ فَاصْنَعْ مَا شِئْتَ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong> said, “Among the words that people have inherited from the previous prophets are: ‘If you feel no shame, then do as you wish.’” <i>(HR. Bukhari, no. 3483)</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Hadith Authentication: This hadith was narrated by Al-Bukhari through Manshur bin Al-Mu’tamar from Rib’iy bin Hirasy from Abu Mas’ud from Hudzaifah from the <strong>Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong>. There are differences in the chain of narration of this hadith. However, most scholars of hadith considered it a statement of Abu Mas’ud. This opinion was held by Al-Bukhari, Abu Zur’ah, Ar-Razi, Ad-Daruquthniy, and others. The evidence supporting this view is that it was also narrated in another way, from Abu Mas’ud through Masruq, and also recorded by Ath-Thabraniy from Abu Ath-Thufail from the <strong>Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong>. (See Jami’ Al-‘Ulum wa Al-Hikam, p. 255, Ibn Rajab Al-Hambali, Darul Hadith Al-Qahirah)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">**Modesty as a Legacy of the Prophets**  
Ibn Rajab Al-Hambali (may Allah have mercy on him) said regarding the statement in this hadith:</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
إِنَّ مِمَّا أَدْرَكَ النَّاسُ مِنْ كَلاَمِ النُّبُوَّةِ الأُوْلَى
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Indeed, among the words that people inherited from the previous prophets...”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">He explained: “This hadith shows that modesty is a remnant of the teachings of the earlier prophets. It was transmitted and passed down from the prophets in every generation. This proves that the earlier prophets commonly conveyed this phrase until it became widespread among people and eventually reached the Muslim ummah.” <i>(Jami’ Al-‘Ulum wa Al-Hikam, p. 255)</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The phrase <em>(النُّبُوَّةِ الأُوْلَى)</em> refers to the earlier prophets, starting from the first messengers such as Nuh, Ibrahim, and others. <i>(Sharh Arba’in, Shaykh Salih Alu Shaykh, p. 112).</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The sayings of earlier nations could have been transmitted through revelation (the Qur’an), Sunnah (hadith of the <strong>Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong>), or the words of earlier people. <i>(Sharh Arba’in, Shaykh Salih Alu Shaykh, p. 207)</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Since this was a saying of previous prophets, it shows its great significance and benefit, thus it must be given due attention.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">**Sharia Before Islam**  
There is an important lesson to be understood. The laws of previous prophets before <strong>Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong> fall into three categories:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">1) Teachings confirmed by Islam, which are valid and accepted.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">2) Teachings nullified by Islam, which are false and rejected.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">3) Teachings whose status is unknown in Islam; the correct approach is to withhold judgment. However, if such sayings are shared for advice or moral lessons, it is permissible, provided they are not deemed absolutely correct. <i>(See Sharh Arba’in, Shaykh Ibn Uthaymeen, pp. 207-208)</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">**The Virtue of Modesty**  
Modesty is a branch of faith. <strong>The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong> said:</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
الْحَيَاءُ شُعْبَةٌ مِنَ الإِيمَانِ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Modesty is a branch of faith.” <i>(HR. Muslim, no. 161)</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Allah also praises modesty.  
<strong>The Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong> said:</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
إِنَّ اللَّهَ عَزَّ وَجَلَّ حَيِىٌّ سِتِّيرٌ يُحِبُّ الْحَيَاءَ وَالسَّتْرَ فَإِذَا اغْتَسَلَ أَحَدُكُمْ فَلْيَسْتَتِرْ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">“Indeed, Allah is Modest and Concealing. He loves modesty and concealment. Therefore, when one of you bathes, let him conceal himself.” <i>(HR. Abu Dawud, no. 4014, authenticated by Shaykh Al-Albani)</i></p>
