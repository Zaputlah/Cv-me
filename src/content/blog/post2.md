**I Am Only an Ordinary Human**

<p style="text-align: justify;">When reflecting on life and human virtues, we often fall into the tendency of elevating ourselves, forgetting that in reality we are all just ordinary human beings. No matter how great our achievements or our position in the eyes of the world, we are never free from limitations and mistakes.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Qur’an and the hadiths of the <strong>Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong> remind us of this reality, offering a clear perspective on human nature and the importance of remaining humble before Allah.</p>

### 1. Human Limitations in the Qur’an

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the Qur’an, Allah the Exalted reminds us of the weakness of mankind and its tendency toward mistakes. Allah says:</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
ذٰلِكَ الْيَوْمُ الْحَقُّۚ فَمَنْ شَاۤءَ اتَّخَذَ اِلٰى رَبِّهٖ مَاٰبًا
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

*"And man [himself] is in constant toil [to achieve what he desires]."* <i>(QS. An-Naba: 39)</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This verse implies that human beings are essentially created with a nature that is prone to hardship and error. Even though people possess potential and abilities, when faced with trials and challenges of life, they often feel weak and powerless.</p>

### 2. The Presence of Mistakes in the Hadith

<p style="text-align: justify;">The hadiths of <strong>Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong> also emphasize the limitations of human beings. The Prophet himself, as the most noble messenger of Allah, gave an example of simplicity and openness about human weakness.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">One hadith that reflects this is:</p>


<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
كُلُّ ابْنِ آدَمَ خَطَّاءٌ وَخَيْرُ الْخَطَّائِيْنَ التَّوَّابُوْنَ.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">

*"Every son of Adam commits mistakes, and the best of those who make mistakes are those who repent."* (HR. Tirmidhi)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this hadith, <strong>Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong> conveyed that mistakes are part of human life. However, the virtue of a person does not lie in perfection or freedom from mistakes, but in the ability to admit errors and repent sincerely to Allah.</p>

### 3. Humility and Self-Awareness

<p style="text-align: justify;">The key to overcoming human limitations and mistakes lies in humility and self-awareness. Even though we may have talents or strengths, acknowledging that we are fragile beings who depend entirely on Allah is the first step towards a deeper understanding of ourselves.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Allah the Exalted says in the Qur’an:</p>

<p style="font-family: 'Neirizi Regular', sans-serif; font-size: 25px; direction: rtl;">
اَلَّذِيْنَ يَجْتَنِبُوْنَ كَبٰۤىِٕرَ الْاِثْمِ وَالْفَوَاحِشَ اِلَّا اللَّمَمَۙ اِنَّ رَبَّكَ وَاسِعُ الْمَغْفِرَةِۗ هُوَ اَعْلَمُ بِكُمْ اِذْ اَنْشَاَكُمْ مِّنَ الْاَرْضِ وَاِذْ اَنْتُمْ اَجِنَّةٌ فِيْ بُطُوْنِ اُمَّهٰتِكُمْۗ فَلَا تُزَكُّوْٓا اَنْفُسَكُمْۗ هُوَ اَعْلَمُ بِمَنِ اتَّقٰىࣖ
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

*"So do not claim yourselves to be pure; He is most knowing of who fears Him."* (QS. An-Najm: 32)</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The importance of keeping a humble heart and acknowledging Allah’s greatness should never be underestimated. This humility brings us closer to Him and helps us avoid arrogance and pride.</p>

### Conclusion

<p style="text-align: justify;">Through the Qur’an and the hadiths of the <strong>Messenger of Allah (peace and blessings be upon him)</strong>, we are given a deep understanding of human nature and our duty to remain humble before Allah. Even if we may have certain accomplishments or advantages, we must never forget that we are merely ordinary human beings prone to mistakes. Therefore, the first step toward goodness is to recognize our limitations and always submit ourselves sincerely to Allah.</p>
